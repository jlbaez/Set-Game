###How to Run
You can use the SetSolverRun to see some preset to run.
1. compile SetSolverRun
2. run java SetSolverRun
 
####Run Test
I've included a JUnit test in SetSolverTest and the jar required to run the test is in the lib folder.<br/>
From the src directory:<br/>
1. compile ` javac -cp .:"../lib/*" SetSolverTest.java`<br/>
2. run `java -cp .:"../lib/*" org.junit.runner.JUnitCore SetSolverTest`
